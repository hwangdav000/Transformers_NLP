# Analysis of GPT and BERT based Transformer Models
</br>
For more detailed information you can find in my paper:

[Paper Here](Transformer_Analysis.pdf)

Where I compared RoBERTa, BERT, GPT2, GPTNeo1.3B on NLP tasks sentiment analysis (SA), natural language inference (NLI), question answering (QA)

You can find the Datasets that I used for NLP tasks here:
</br>
SST (Sentiment Analysis):

SNLI (Natural Language Inference):

I found that BERT performed best on SNLI (Natural Language Inference), RoBERTa performed best on SQUAD2.0 (Question Answer), and
GPT-NEO performed best on SST (Sentiment Analysis).
